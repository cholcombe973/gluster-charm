options:
  volume_name:
    type: string
    default: test
    description: |
      The name of the Gluster volume to create.  This will also serve as the name
      of the mount point.  Example: mount -t glusterfs server1:/test
  cluster_type:
    type: string
    default: Replicate
    description: |
      The type of volume to setup.  Replicate is sufficient for most use cases.
      Other options include: Distribute,
        Stripe,
        StripedAndReplicate,
        Disperse,
        DistributedAndStripe,
        DistributedAndReplicate,
        DistributedAndStripedAndReplicate,
        DistributedAndDisperse.
  replication_level:
    type: int
    default: 2
    description: |
      This sets how many replicas of the data should be stored in the cluster.
      Generally 2 or 3 will be fine for almost all use cases.  Greater than 3
      could be useful for read heavy uses cases.
  filesystem_type:
    type: string
    default: xfs
    description: |
      The filesystem type to use for each one of the bricks.  Can be either
      xfs, btrfs, or ext4
  source:
    type: string
    default: ppa:gluster/glusterfs-3.8
    description: |
      Optional configuration to support use of additional sources such as:
        - ppa:myteam/ppa
        - cloud:trusty-proposed/kilo
        - http://my.archive.com/ubuntu main
      The last option should be used in conjunction with the key configuration
      option. NOTE: Changing this configuration value after your cluster is
      deployed will initiate a rolling upgrade of the servers one by one.
  key:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Key ID to import to the apt keyring to support use with arbitary source
      configuration from outside of Launchpad archives or PPA's.
  encryption:
    type: boolean
    default: false
    description: |
      Enabling this option will turn on SSL encryption for client, replication
      and management traffic on the cluster. This is not encryption at rest
      but rather encryption while transmitting over the wire.
