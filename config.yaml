options:
  volume_name:
    type: string
    default: test
    description: |
      The name of the Gluster volume to create.  This will also serve as the name
      of the mount point.  Example: mount -t glusterfs server1:/test
  cluster_type:
    type: string
    default: Replicate
    description: |
      The type of volume to setup.  Replicate is sufficient for most use cases.
      Other options include: Distribute,
        Stripe,
        StripedAndReplicate,
        Disperse,
        DistributedAndStripe,
        DistributedAndReplicate,
        DistributedAndStripedAndReplicate,
        DistributedAndDisperse.
  replication_level:
    type: int
    default: 2
    description: |
      This sets how many replicas of the data should be stored in the cluster.
      Generally 2 or 3 will be fine for almost all use cases.  Greater than 3
      could be useful for read heavy uses cases.
  filesystem_type:
    default: xfs
    description: |
      The filesystem type to use for each one of the bricks.  Can be either
      xfs, btrfs, or ext4
